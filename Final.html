Hey.. Good morning. How are you? I hope you're good. So - dw everything's good on this website you don't have to worry about your data cuz i have made this with all safety measures(you have to find who made  it ). You might be wondering that 'Why I made it?' and the answer is - IDK too, but inshort i will say... I love to do those things which make you happy.. happy.. happy!!! Okay?  So...Bae, You're a wonderful person. A  intelligent, kind hearted person and ofc you're so pretty pretty (god invested so much time on you) cuz those beautiful eyes ahhhhhh (I'm not moaning, i am *melting*) and your hairs, and and and everything about you is so fucking incredible! But let's talk about the most beautiful thing about you - The most beautiful thing about you is:- You're a real person, you're not scared to show your real personality to anyone and I love that about you (oh gosh idk how many things I love about you. I can't even mention all those things 💀). Aree inn cheezo se yaad aaya Let me share you the new episode of 'Story with Tanish' kyunki baate to abi utni nai ho rhi hmare beech.

So 1 June ki baat hai ye aur I was in train Delhi aane ke liye to mere cabin main Charging adapter nai chal rha tha sirf mera hi nahi pure train ka nahi chal rha tha to bhyii mujhe gussa aa gya aur maine sidha Railways ke headquarters ko phone lga kr bol diya "Ye tumhari train ka charging adapter kyu nhi chal rha hai 🗣️🗣️" aur ek glti ye ho gyi jis time maine ye bolke phone kaata ussi time charger chalne lg gye to for a second maine socha "apan hi bhagwan hai" kyunki phone kat krte hi chalne lg gya adapter but kuch ghante ke baad aaya ek Banda he was saying ki bhyii report kri hai ki adapter nai chal rha to maine bola ha ab chal rha hai 🥰 he was staring deep inside my soul like wo mujhe utha utha ke patkega 💀😭. (Kyu krta hu main aisi bakchodi)
) Ek aur story hai aur wo isse bhi zyada interesting but wo baad main wo baad main btaunga.
So let's come back to the topic yayayay 
Btw it's a normal letter  😭 i actually thought ki kuch unique krte hai  to thoda inspire hua aur Coding sikhi aur ye kr diya 💀 -

Chinta na kar tujhe bhaga kr le jaunga saari problem se chutkara mil jayega tujhe 😋 (I was joking sorry 😭) And and and I'm with you cuz I don't want you to feel alone in this hard time wo baat alag hai distance ki wajh se waise bhi tu alone feel kregi but still my soul and God are with you. Just take care of yourself aur ham jldi milenge 😋. </p>
